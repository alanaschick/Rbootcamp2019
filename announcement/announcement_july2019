The  International Microbiome Centreâ€™s bioinformatics platform is announcing 
two courses to be offered in 2019
R for Biologists Bootcamp -August 12-14, 2019
16s rRNA sequencing Analysis - October 7-9, 2019

1. 'R for Biologists Bootcamp' which will be taking place on August  12-14, 2019.
The purpose of this course is to teach scientists (students, postdocs, PIs, and staff) in biological and medical sciences to use R for typical data analysis tasks they might encounter routinely. No prior knowledge of R is expected and workshop attendees can expect to come away with a skill set that is immediately translatable to their respective data tasks.

2. With R programming as a prerequisite, we will be offering an introductory course on '16s rRNA sequencing Analysis' on October 7-9, 2019. 
This course will  provide hands on experience to people wanting to learn the basics of microbiome analysis. With an example microbiome dataset, we will take attendees through all the steps needed to transform raw reads into meaningful community profile plots.
