## About this course
<p>

This course is offered by the <b>International Microbiome Centre</b> at the University of Calgary. The purpose of this course is to teach scientists (students, postdocs, PIs) in the biological and medical sciences to use R for typical data analysis tasks they might encounter routinely. This includes sequence analysis and other bioinformatics tasks.
<i> No prior knowledge of R is expected and workshop attendees can expect to come away with a skill set that is immediately translatable to their respective data tasks.</i></p>

<br>

## Format

<p>
To maximize the R skills and confidence attendees gain from this workshop, we have chosen to combine online learning materials with actual instruction days. 
<br>
<p>
We will use [datacamp's](https://www.datacamp.com/home) virtual classroom tool to train participants in basic R. About three weeks prior to the workshop, each attendee will receive a datacamp account with a list of assigned courses and assignments. Progress of each student will be monitored by the instructors. Prior to the workshop a Q &A session will be organized to review installation of R and RStudio and the Datacamp material.<font color="red"> Attendees will need to spend 4-6 hours on course material every week.</font> 
</p>
<p>
On the instruction days of the workshop, the knowledge gained from course work will be used to complete a biologialy relevant project.  </p>
