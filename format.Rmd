To maximize the R skills and confidence attendees gain from this workshop, we have chosen to combine online learning materials with actual instruction days. 
<br>
<p>
We will use [datacamp's](https://www.datacamp.com/home) virtual classroom tool to train attendees in basic R. A month prior to the workshop, each attendee will receive a datacamp account with a list of assigned courses and assignments. Progress of each student will be monitored by the instructors and a Q &A session will be organized to review the course material at the end of each week.<font color="red"> Attendees will need to spend 4-6 hours on course material every week.</font> 
</p>
<p>
On the days of the workshop, the knowledge gained from course work will be used to complete a biologialy relevant project.  </p>
