# Pre-workshop session - Welcome to R!

In this session we will go over some housekeeping details such as communication and installation of R and RStudio. We will introduce the basics of R and RStudio as well as the assigned Datacamp material. Lastly, we will discuss the project you will complete during the workshop. 
<br>
<br>

## <b> 1. Setup your slack account </b>

For communication during this workshop, we will use Slack. I have sent everyone an invitation to join our Calbug slack workspace. In this workspace we have a channel named <font color="red">rbootcamp2019 </font> which will be used to carry out all communication. This will be the best place to ask us questions or discuss topics as a group. If you have not received the email, please signup using the following link:

## <b> 2. Installation </b>
 
R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment and RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You will need to install R before you install RStudio.

<b> If you already have R and RStudio installed</b>, open RStudio and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is available, quit RStudio and download the latest version of RStudio. To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and check the top of the console to see which version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display the version of R you are running. Go on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it.

<b> If you don't have R and RStudio installed</b>, please follow the instructions for your operating system below.

### Windows
* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select RStudio for Windows
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

### MacOS
* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
* Double click on the downloaded file to install R
* It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed
  by some packages)
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select RStudio for MacOS
* Double click the file to install RStudio
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.
  
### For everyone
After installing R and RStudio, you need to install the `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` packages.

* After starting RStudio, in the console type:
  `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2"))`

## <b> 4. Basic Introduction to R </b>
  
We will go over what R is and what are the very basics of it. Things like how to set a working directory, what are the best practices of setting up directory structure for your work and what to avoid.
<br>
<br>

## <b> 5. DataCamp Courses </b>
  
You have been assigned three Datacamp courses to be completed prior to the workshop: 
  
* Introduction to R
* Introduction to the Tidyverse
* Data Visualization with ggplot2 (part 1)
  
Please have these courses completed by the start of the workshop.
